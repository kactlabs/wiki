# Give 'em a Laptop

**Note:** a new initiative from Tact Labs



**Yes**

We want to give school kids and see what do they learn in th laptop!

It's a simple curiosity based social research program initiated by Tact Labs.

#### How it works?
We will give a kid laptop for 3 weeks and ask them to learn anything they want. 

We observe the kid like which area he is very interested

We will summarize our observation and archive in our leanring repository.


#### How can you help us out?
As it is a social and learning research program, we want your support to find the curious kids who are in the school and want to learn somthing. If you think any kid in your circle who can be the best fit for our observation program, just let us know and we will reach them out.

It's a learning psychology program where we want to observe how kids think, learn and view this world. We will just observe the learners and we won't force them to learn anything in specific.
