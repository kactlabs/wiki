Why merge when you can rebase and cause more conflicts?

I'm not arguing, I'm just passionately discussing the possibility of your suggestion being wrong.
I can't believe I'm committing to this.
I'm not saying it's your fault, but it can't be mine either.
Just because I have a red face doesn't mean I'm angry, it could just be a really bad sunburn.
Let's just agree to disagree and call it a merge.
I refuse to argue with someone who's not even on the same branch as me.
I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of how awesome this commit is.
I can't believe I accidentally committed all my unfinished code.
I'm not saying I'm the best coder in the world, but I'm definitely not a git.
Merge conflict? More like merge convenience.
I don't always make commits, but when I do, I make them count.
I'm not saying I'm a git wizard, but I did just magic this merge conflict away.
I'm sorry, I can't do that Dave. I'm a git, not a psychic.
Why are we even having this merge conflict? Can't we just all get along?
I'm not saying I'm a git god, but I am divinely inspired when it comes to resolving merge conflicts.
Git push? More like git smashed.
I'm sorry, I can't let you do that. This repository is protected by a team of highly trained git specialists.
I may not be a ninja, but I can definitely git-fu my way out of this merge conflict.
I'm not saying my code is perfect, but at least it's better than whatever caused this merge conflict.
