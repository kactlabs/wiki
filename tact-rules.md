Do it Right

```

Leave Policy 

```
- if you go on leave for more than 2 days, we will have to consider Loss of Pay. 
  As we are a small company, we can't afford to have more than 2 days off.
- Please provide medical certificates if you have health issue more than 3 days.
- You can request request for a long leave if any personal plans. However, 
  it comes under LOP (Loss of Pay) as well.
