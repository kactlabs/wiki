## Descriptions  

- This is a really simple game with very few rules, but make sure you dont forget the rules of the game on the go. This is a two player game. 

- The game starts with any random word given by the judge, player1 should give another word related to the given word and player 2 should give a word related to player1's word. 

- You are not suppose to use shortforms or abbrivations. The loop will continue until someone breaks the rule.
