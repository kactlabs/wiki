##### Summary:
A majority of college graduates say that students who recently left school will get a lower return on their degree than they would have a decade ago, according to a report released on Tuesday by an educational technology company, Greenwood Hall. The report was based on a poll of 2,000 people, 900 of them college graduates of all ages, conducted by Nielsen for Greenwood Hall. Respondents pointed to high student debt and low starting salaries as the chief culprits for what they saw as the declining value of college.

Young people with college degrees made $17,500 more than did their peers who had not pursued an education past high school in 2013, according to a 2014 Pew Research Center analysis (PDF) of Census Bureau data. With the earnings premium higher than it has been in the modern era, college degree holders can expect to earn around $500,000 more over a lifetime than they would have earned if they opted out of the classroom after 12th grade, says Rick Fry, a Pew economist who conducted the analysis.
