## Gamified Learning Workshop

**Note:** Teaching Coding along Games


### 10:00 AM - General Talk (15 minutes)
#### Why Coding? 
  - Because in a world where machines learn faster than humans, we need to keep up! Remember, countries are hungry for coders like the Cookie Monster is for cookies.
#### Why Games?
  - Not just for fun but for brain gains! Play strategic ones like Age of Empires but don’t overdo it – unless you plan to become a professional couch potato.



### 10:15 AM - Game Session (15 minutes)
  - Time for a gaming break! Remember, even superheroes need a little playtime.


### 10:30 AM - Python with Simple Unique Idea (40 minutes)
  - Dive into Python: where coding meets creativity, and predicting countries is more fun than a magic 8-ball.
  - Unleash your inner coding wizard with Python – who knows, your code might just predict the future!

### 11:10 AM - Break (10 minutes)
  - Take 10! Stretch, snack, or daydream about becoming the next coding superstar.
  - Break time! Remember, even computers need to reboot.


### 11:20 AM - Python Improvements (40 minutes)
  - Lunchtime! Refuel your brain, but don't forget to come back. The code won't write itself!
  - Grab a byte to eat – see what we did there?


### 12:40 PM - 10 Minutes Game
  - Game time again! It's like a mini-vacation for your mind.
  - Ready, set, game! Because all work and no play makes Jack a dull coder.


### 12:50 PM - HTML Basics (10 minutes)
  - HTML Basics: where you learn to speak browser-ish in just 10 minutes!
  - Dive into HTML – it's like the ABCs for the internet, only cooler.


### 1:30 PM - Break (10 minutes)
  - Break time! Do the robot dance, have a snack, or just chill.
  - Time to pause and refresh – you're not a robot... yet!


### 1:40 PM - Tech Quiz (20 minutes)
  - Tech Quiz time! It's like Jeopardy for geeks but without Alex Trebek.
  - Get ready to buzz in! This quiz will test your tech smarts more than Siri or Alexa could.


### 2:00 PM - Flask Integration and Code Improvements (40 minutes)
  - Flask Integration: because your code deserves a fancy web flask, not a dusty old file.
  - Time to give your code a new home on the web with Flask – let's make it internet-famous!



### 2:40 PM - Break (20 minutes)
  - Another break? You bet! Stretch, daydream, or doodle – your brain will thank you.
  - 20-minute break: perfect for a power nap or a power snack. Your choice!


### 3:00 PM - Game Time (60 minutes)
  - Game time! Unleash your inner gamer and show off those strategic skills.
  - It's game o'clock! Time to put those gaming thumbs to work and maybe win some bragging rights.


### Winner Announcement
  - Winner scoring system:
      - 70% Game Points, 30% Tech Points 
      - may the most balanced team win! And remember, in our world, geeks are the real superheroes.
  - Winning isn't everything, but 500 INR sure feels good! Play smart, code smarter.


### Team Guidelines
  - Teams of 3 to 6 – because too many coders spoil the code (just kidding, the more the merrier)!
  - One teacher assistant per team – because Google is great, but human help is priceless.
