## Gamified Learning Workshop

**Note:** tbw


10:00 AM - General Talk (15 minutes)
Why Coding? 
  Because in a world where machines learn faster than humans, we need to keep up! Remember, countries are hungry for coders like the Cookie Monster is for cookies.
Why Games?
  Not just for fun but for brain gains! Play strategic ones like Age of Empires but don’t overdo it – unless you plan to become a professional couch potato.


10:15 AM - Game Session (15 minutes)
Time for a gaming break! Remember, even superheroes need a little playtime.
