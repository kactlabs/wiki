From the humble beginnings of a rural school in Odiapatti to becoming a transformative force in tech education, Raja CSP Raman's story is a testament to the power of giving back. As an alumnus of Thiagarajar College of Engineering, he cut his teeth working alongside IIT Madras professors at NMSWorks which is a parent company of Zoho, laying the foundation for an impressive career spanning multiple continents.

His pursuit of knowledge took him to Canada's Humber Institute of Technology in Toronto, where he not only excelled in his studies but also built a successful career working with American and European clients across diverse tech domains - from ticketing systems to retail and gaming technology. While climbing the corporate ladder, Raja never forgot his roots. He transformed his weekends into opportunities to mentor students from rural backgrounds, teaching them cutting-edge technologies through one-on-one sessions.

The impact of his dedication speaks volumes: 380 students have secured their first jobs through his guidance, with over 30 of them now earning more than â‚¹20 lakhs annually. His commitment to education extends beyond mentoring - he's authored "Building RESTful Web Services with Spring 5" and published 8 research papers on Arxiv, with a ninth in progress. What makes these publications special is that they're all collaborative efforts with students, embodying his philosophy of nurturing the next generation through applied research.

After earning his Canadian citizenship and spending 13 enriching years in Ontario (2010-2023), Raja made the heartfelt decision to return to India to support his parents. Now based near Coimbatore, he's about to embark on a new challenge as the Head of AI & Engineering at Aracor AI, where he'll lead a team of 15-20 members.

His passion for nurturing talent continues through the Featurepreneur slack community, an invitation-only platform focused on student development. Even as he prepares to take on his new role, Raja is actively seeking research interns for his upcoming 10th research paper, proving that his commitment to mentoring never wavers.

When he's not shaping the future of tech education, you might find him unwinding with a John Grisham novel - a small glimpse into the human side of this inspiring tech mentor who has dedicated his life to lifting others as he climbs.

For aspiring technologists, Raja's journey shows that true success isn't just about personal achievement - it's about creating pathways for others to succeed. Through his blend of technical expertise, practical industry experience, and unwavering commitment to education, he continues to light the way for the next generation of tech innovators.
