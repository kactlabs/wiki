# Rules to be followed when creating a repository

Always include these files when we create a python repository:

* .gitignore

    - You can get the sample .gitignore content from http://wiki.tactii.com/gitignore.html

* .env.sample if the project has an env

* requirements.txt

    - Include modules used in the project along with its version

* readme.md 

    - A proper documentation of the project
