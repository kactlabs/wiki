# YIC

## Youth Investors Club

The Youth Investors Club is a newly formed club that primarily 
focuses on inculcating stock and finance knowledge in the minds of 
youngsters.

There are several members in the club who have been assigned 
under a specific team leader, where they pick their stocks 
and monitor the profits and other aspects on a daily basis.
The monitoring period lasts for about 30-40 days per cycle.

All the profits earned by the team members will be split in such
a manner that 60% of it goes to the team members whereas the rest
goes to the Featurepreneur community.

There'll be a total of 2-5 members in each team.

We'll essentially be focusing on the current Indian Market.  

With recurring meetings and fruitful discussions amongst all members
concerned, the YIC aims to engage and enhance the financial 
skill sets.
