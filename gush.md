# Gush

**Note:** quick git push for one-way commits


Create a gush file in your desired location and create a file
```
cd /Users/myname/d/gitmagic
touch gu.sh
```


Add these into gu.sh file
```
git add .

git commit -m "Updates for $(date +%F)"

git push
```

Change mod
```
chmod u+x gu.sh
```

gu.sh 3.0:
```
git_push_with_chatgpt()
{
  
    git pull

    # sleep 3 seconds
    sleep 2

    git add .

    # path to the file
    file_path="/Users/fpr11/tact/gitmagic/gcommit-chatgpt.txt"

    # using wc command to count number of lines
    number_of_lines=`wc -l < $file_path`

    # echo $((number_of_lines))

    rando_number=`shuf -i 1-$((number_of_lines)) -n 1`

    # echo $rando_number

    line=`sed $((rando_number))!d $file_path`
    # echo $line

    git commit -m "$line: Updates for $(date +%F)"

    git push

}

git_push_with_vanilla()
{
    echo "calling Vanilla"
    
    git add .

    git commit -m "Updates for $(date +%F)"

    git push
}

# Testing

I'm not arguing, I'm just passionately discussing the possibility of your suggestion being wrong.
I can't believe I'm committing to this.
I'm not saying it's your fault, but it can't be mine either.
Just because I have a red face doesn't mean I'm angry, it could just be a really bad sunburn.
Let's just agree to disagree and call it a merge.
I refuse to argue with someone who's not even on the same branch as me.
I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of how awesome this commit is.
I can't believe I accidentally committed all my unfinished code.
I'm not saying I'm the best coder in the world, but I'm definitely not a git.
Merge conflict? More like merge convenience.
I don't always make commits, but when I do, I make them count.
I'm not saying I'm a git wizard, but I did just magic this merge conflict away.
I'm sorry, I can't do that Dave. I'm a git, not a psychic.
Why are we even having this merge conflict? Can't we just all get along?
I'm not saying I'm a git god, but I am divinely inspired when it comes to resolving merge conflicts.
Git push? More like git smashed.
I'm sorry, I can't let you do that. This repository is protected by a team of highly trained git specialists.
I may not be a ninja, but I can definitely git-fu my way out of this merge conflict.
I'm not saying my code is perfect, but at least it's better than whatever caused this merge conflict.
I'm not saying your code is bad, but it's like a koala on fire running away from a tsunami.
I'm not saying your code is bad, but it's like a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest.
I'm not saying your code is bad, but it's like a blind squirrel trying to find a nut in a minefield.
I'm not saying your code is bad, but it's like a fish out of water flailing around on the runway.
I'm not saying your code is bad, but it's like a cat trying to play the piano with its tail.
I'm not saying your code is bad, but it's like a giraffe in a phone booth.
I'm not saying your code is bad, but it's like a chicken trying to play soccer.
I'm not saying your code is bad, but it's like a clown trying to tell a knock-knock joke in sign language.
I'm not saying your code is bad, but it's like a dolphin trying to do stand-up comedy.
I'm not saying your code is bad, but it's like a kangaroo trying to dance the tango.
I'm not saying your code is bad, but it's like a penguin trying to fly a plane.
I'm not saying your code is bad, but it's like a monkey trying to drive a car.
I'm not saying your code is bad, but it's like a llama trying to play baseball.
I'm not saying your code is bad, but it's like a frog trying to play the trumpet.
I'm not saying your code is bad, but it's like a walrus trying to play tennis.
