# How to Ask for Updates 

The following points must be considered while asking for updates to Interns

* Ask them to share their task on trello
```

    If the task is not  yet updated  tell them to update it

```
* Ask  how much  progress they have made 
```

    The progress collected must be concrete

``` 
* Ask them about Estimated Time for Completion  
```

    The Estimated time must be concrete. 
    If they can complete the task by today then relative time is acceptable.

```

* Ask them whether they are facing any issues with the task 
```

    Ask the Intern whether they are facing any problem and can they complete it, 
    or they need help
