# TactSay Tech: Numpy 

1. NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.

2. NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

3. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

4. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray

5. NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python

6. NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists (which can grow dynamically). 

7. NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data.

8. Travis Oliphant created NumPy package in 2005

9. It is an extension module of Python which is mostly written in C

10. It efficiently implements the multidimensional arrays.
