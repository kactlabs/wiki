# Drum Effect

When we do the social analytics on "Opportunity Index", we found a new thing: only two communities suffer the most in South India.

First you obviously know SC/ST. Everyone is blaming this community and reservation is a number one thing which affecting Indian growth blah blah blah. SC/ST become a mocking term and even mentioned in public news papers when they search for bride/bridegroom (like "Caste no bar excluding SC/ST").

Second is FC who got 10% quota recently. You might not agree with us but the reality is stranger what you think. Still some students being mocked in the public place for being a vegetarion, keeping their faith. But we see still some FC students come from rural places, not getting enough opportunities to upgrade thier lifestyle. No big media talks about it (at least in South India).

These two communities suffer like anything as they get beaten up by the views of people like Drum (Mathalam) and these two communities getting psychological presssure hence they suffer in economy wise as well.

As helping both communities, we do extra care on these community based students and we help them to start their IT/ML careers with us.

If you know any one who is from either one of these communities and they are struggling to upgrade in IT/ML, please talk to us by simple eamil info@tactii.com.

We will schedule a meeting with the candidates and start helping to shape up their career.
