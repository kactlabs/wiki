2. Scrapy is maintained by Zyte (formerly Scrapinghub) and many other contributors.

4. Scrapy project architecture is built around "spiders",which are self-contained crawlers that are given a set of instructions.

5. it makes it easier to build and scale large crawling projects by allowing developers to reuse their code.

6. The Scrapy framework provides you with powerful features such as auto-throttle, rotating proxies and user-agents,
allowing you scrape virtually undetected across the net.

7. Scrapy also provides a web-crawling shell,which can be used by developers to test their assumptions on a siteâ€™s behavior.

8. It does not require separate libraries for every other step,and middlewares can also be used in Scrapy.

9. The engine is responsible for controlling the data flow between all components of the system.
