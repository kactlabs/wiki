**Client:** North American Retailer<br>
**Year:** 2020<br>
**Industry:** Retail<br>
**Services Provided:** Proof of Concept (POC), Machine Learning, Printer Classification<br>

### Problem
The retailer needed a machine learning solution to classify printers in their inventory, but they lacked an internal ML team to take on the project. This capability was essential for their operations and potential future development.

### Solution
Tact developed a proof of concept (POC) to demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in solving the retailer’s printer classification needs:

1. **Cutting-Edge Printer Classification Model:**
   Tact built a custom ML model designed to accurately classify printers based on various attributes, providing the retailer with a clear example of how ML could streamline their operations.

2. **Increased Management Buy-In for Phase 2:**
   The success of the POC convinced the retailer's management of the model's potential, leading them to fund a full implementation in Phase 2.
