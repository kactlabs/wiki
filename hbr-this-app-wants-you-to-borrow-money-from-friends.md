##### Summary:
Trust builds over time. This happens organically when you're around a person in real life, but Puddle obviously didn't have the luxury.

Puddle sits between the integration of Facebook and Reddit - Facebook because it grabs onto your social graph, Reddit because there's a reward system for a good behavior and common interests.

On Puddle you can peruse profiles and see anyone's payback rate.
