## TactLabs Repo Standard

**Note:** Following some rules will make us to create a better group



### Repo Standard
- Every repo should be in lowercase and - should be used instead of _ or space
- Every repo should have readme.md file
- readme.md should explain about the project in 2-3 lines
- readme.md should explain how to run the project
- Every repo should have .gitignore file 
- For sample .gitignore, check here: [.gitignore](https://wiki.tactii.com/gitignore.html)
- Every Python repo should contain .env ad .env.sample (if any sensitive info used in the project)
- Every Python repo should contain requirements.txt file
- if requirements.txt available, it should have clear version mentioned (sample: flask==1.2.2)
- Team leads should take the responsibility to make sure the team is following the standards


Examples:
```
branch: Testimonial-page - is wrong
branch: testimonial-page - is right

html: Quote.html - is wrong
html: quote.html - is right

html: Webinar_one.html - is wrong
html: webinar-one.html - is right
```


### Always include these files when we create a python repository:

* .gitignore

    - You can get the sample .gitignore content from [.gitignore](https://wiki.tactii.com/gitignore.html)
    - Make sure .env is in .gitignore file when you have .env file available in your project
    <br>
* .env.sample if the project has an env

* requirements.txt

    - Include modules used in the project along with its version

    - Sample:
        <br>
        Flask - is wrong
        <br>
        Flask==2.2.2  - is right


* readme.md 

    - A proper documentation of the project
