## Employee Orientation

**Note:** version 1.2 | July 2024





### Work hours:
9 am - 7 pm

### Lunch break:
- 45 minutes (anytime)
- Night Owls can join any time of the day as the 9am restriction will not impact them.

### Coffee break
- You can go for a quick break by conveying the team by quoting "going 5 minutes break"
- Breaks can be upto 20 minutes.
- You don't need to say things explicitly like below:
    - "sir 5 mins i want to refill my water bottle"
    - "someone is at the door, I will go and collect my food from them"


### Slack Dos and Donts:
- No Message in the "General"
- When you go to break, update the status
- When you are on day off, update the status with your rejoining date/time.
- If someone sent a message in the group, please use emojis as a cofirmation that you read the message.


### Trello
- 2 tasks per day
- You should mention hours you worked like this format "Contribution: 2hrs"
- Before moving the task to "testing", update your contribution hours
- If you worked on any specific github repo, keep the link in the activity section
- Sprint starts on Monday and ends with after 10 days of currrent sprint, usually on Saturday. We will analyze employees' contribution hours and discuss with them in person on how to improve the productivity

### Internal Hackathon
- Bi-weekly hackathon will get you 500-1000 INR credits towards productivity related gifts.
- 30 hours in 3 days is expected as minimum hours to be eligible to win the prize
- Top performer will get the prize. Contribution hours may not impact the winner always.


### GitHub
- If you are asked to work on Github, by default you should create a branch on the specific repo.
- Usually new branch naming convention: "<yourname>-work"
- If you are told explicitly about the branch name, that takes the higher priority over "<yourname>-work"
- Most of the time we do PR("Pull Requests") on GitHub. If you create a PR, you are not supposed to review the code and merge. Someone else has to do it.
- At rare times, the same developer will be merging the PR with Manager approval
