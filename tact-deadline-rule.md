# Tact Deadline Rule

**Note:** Without a concrete deadline, we can't make any progress~



**Why should we have a deadline?**

```
The only difference between a goal and a dream is a deadline. 
Deadlines aren't bad. 
They help you organise your time and set priorities.

They make you get going when you might not feel like it.
```

**What are the rules for setting a deadline?**

Never ever say abstract deadlines.

**Bad examples:**
```
* tomorrow
* soon
```


Always use concrete deadlines.

```
Format: Day/Date time timezone
 
Good examples:
* Tuesday 8:00PM IST
* 4th december 9:00AM CST
* ETA Today 9PM EST
```



**What is ETA?**
```
ETA stands for estimated time of arrival

This is a very common phrase that is frequently seen in many forms of text based communication as well as spoken aloud. This term is often used to ask someone when they think they are going to arrive at a previously agreed upon location. 

This can either be responded to with an exact time, or with a range of time. For example, if someone asks another person when they are going to arrive to pick them up, they could say, "My GPS says my ETA is 7:05" or they could say, "My ETA is 15 minutes." 

This slang term initialism is often seen in text messaging and on social media.

**A small tip:**
```
It is okay to push your deadline. 
But always remember "it is better to push your limits than your deadline"
```
