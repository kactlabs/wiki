# Tact Deadline Rule

**Note:** tbw



**Why should we have a deadline?**

```
The only difference between a goal and a dream is a deadline. 
Deadlines aren't bad. 
They help you organise your time and set priorities.

They make you get going when you might not feel like it.
```

**What are the rules for setting a deadline?**

Never ever say abstract deadlines.

**Bad examples:**
```
* tomorrow
* soon
```


Always use concrete deadlines.

```
Format: Day/Date time timezone
 
Good examples:
* Tuesday 8:00PM IST
* 4th december 9:00AM CST
```


**A small tip:**
```
It is okay to push your deadline. 
But always remember "it is better to push your limits than your deadline"
```
