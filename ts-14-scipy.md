# TactSay Tech: Scipy

1. SciPy provides algorithms for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems,algebraic equations, differential equations, statistics and many other classes of problems.

2. The algorithms and data structures provided by SciPy are broadly applicable across domains.

3. Extends NumPy providing additional tools for array computing and provides specialized data structures,such as sparse matrices and k-dimensional trees.

4. SciPy wraps highly-optimized implementations written in low-level languages like Fortran, C, and C++.Enjoy the flexibility of Python with the speed of compiled code.

5. SciPyâ€™s high level syntax makes it accessible and productive for programmers from any background or experience level.
6. SciPy is an open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.

7. It includes modules for statistics, optimization, integration, linear algebra,Fourier transforms, signal and image processing, ODE solvers, and more.

8. SciPy is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines, such as routines for numerical integration and optimization.

9. It develops tutorials, presentations, and other educational materials

10. SciPy is easy to use,but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers.
