# TactSay Tech: Tensorflow

1. TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.

2. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries,and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

3. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research organization to conduct machine learning and deep neural networks research.

4. The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains, as well.

5. TensorFlow provides stable Python and C++ APIs,as well as non-guaranteed backward compatible API for other languages.

6. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.

7. This flexibility lends itself to a range of applications in many different sectors.

8. TensorFlow is Google Brain's second-generation system.

9. Its flexible architecture allows for the easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs),and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices.

10. TensorFlow computations are expressed as stateful dataflow graphs.
