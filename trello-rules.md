## Trello Rules



```
- Every task should have a proper description, deadline
- You have to mention contribution hours before moving it to Testing
- Contribution hours should be in 0.5 or full number hours
	Sample:
                Valid:
		Contribution : 2 hrs
		Contribution : 9.5 hrs
		Invalid:
		Contribution : 9.2 hrs
		Contribution : 45 minutes
- Every week you should cleanup all of your In Progress tasks.
- You can't have "In Progress" on Sunday. If any big task, get approval from the Manager
- Clear Repository proof, photo proof, video proof should be given for your work
