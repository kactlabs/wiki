# TactSay Tech: Pytorch

1. Transition seamlessly between eagerand graph modes with TorchScript, and accelerate the path to production with TorchServe.

2. Scalable distributed training and performance optimization in research and production is enabled by the torch.distributed backend.

3. A rich ecosystem of tools and libraries extends PyTorch and supports development in computer vision, NLP and more.

4. PyTorch is well supported on major cloud platforms, providing frictionless development and easy scaling.

5. You can reuse your favorite Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy,and Cython to extend PyTorch when needed.

6. PyTorch is a machine learning framework based on the Torch library

7. It is free and open-source software released under the modified BSD license.

8. Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development,PyTorch also has a C++ interface.

9. A number of pieces of deep learning software are built on top of PyTorch

10. PyTorch defines a class called Tensor
