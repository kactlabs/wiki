**Note:** 


### T2 Effect (Thallu Thallu Effect):
This goes to Vadivelu’s comedy in ABCD Movie. Some team members act like they are doing something among other team members but no work get done. We have to identify those team members and train them properly so they can have better productivity at work.

### Ohio Effect
This goes to the Psychology book “Influence - The Psychology of Persuasion” where the author did a small case study in Ohio. In this case study they have announced that they will publish the names in the newspaper if the users support emission by using a new product at home (recommended by Ohio local government). Even though they never published as they promised, people like supporting emission.

We call this process Ohio Effect.
