# Tact GIT Conventions

**Note:** code like a pro~






### Follow these in your git commits/repos:

  * Never keep the repo name as lib name
  * Keep the repo in this format:
    ```
    hello-world

    not these formats:
    HelloWorld
    helloWorld
    helloworld
    hello_world
    ```
  * You should keep .gitignore file
  * You are not supposed to commit these folders/files:
    ```
    .vscode
    __pycache__
    .env
    .metals
    ```
  * You are not supposed to commit heavy files like MP4/PNG more than 10 MB. Some exceptions are okay with your TL approval
