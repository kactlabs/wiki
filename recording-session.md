## Recording Session



### When you recording a session for course, follow these:
- Keep it under 15 minutes if possible. However, some expections would be accepted.
- If you have any audience watching the session, they can ask questions once the recording is done. Make sure all audience are muted during the recording
- Give a proper intro about the session
- Make sure no audience shared their video
