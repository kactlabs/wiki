# TactSay Tech: Pandas 


1. The pandas package is the most important tool at the disposal of Data Scientists and Analysts working in Python today.

2. pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

3. Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN, NA, or NaT) in floating point as well as non-floating point data

4. Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects

5. Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations

6. Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data

7. Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects

8. Pandas offers a wide range of functions and methods for data cleaning, transformation, and exploration.

9. It supports reading and writing data from various file formats, including CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and more.

10. Pandas enables data alignment and automatic handling of missing data, reducing manual effort in data cleaning.
