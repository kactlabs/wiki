# TactSay Tech: Scikit Learn


1. scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.

2. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN,and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

3. Scikit-learn is a NumFOCUS fiscally sponsored project.

4. scikit-learn is largely written in Python,and uses NumPy extensively for high-performance linear algebra and array operations.

5. scikit-learn integrates well with many other Python libraries, such as Matplotlib and plotly for plotting,NumPy for array vectorization, Pandas dataframes, SciPy, and many more.

6. scikit-learn was initially developed by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer of Code project in 2007.

7. scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

8. scikit-learn 0.20 was the last version to support Python 2.7 and Python 3.4.

9. Scikit-learn is a Python module integrating a wide range of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for medium-scale supervised and unsupervised problems.

10. Emphasis is put on ease of use, performance, documentation, and API consistency.
