# Tact Availability Schedule


### Rules 
- You can update your availability here: [GS - Tact Availability Schedule](https://bit.ly/tact-upcoming-schedule)

- You should update your schedule 12 hours before your next cycle starts.

- In case of changing your schedule, you should update 4 hours earlier from our regular cycle starts (6pm IST / 8.30 am EST)

- If you come 1 min late, you are late. Tardiness is NOT okay at TactLabs. You should be on your mentioned time according to the schedule. 

- If any emergency and you can't make it on time for the time you mentioned, you should reach your Team Lead and share the situation.
