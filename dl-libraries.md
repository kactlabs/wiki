### Python
http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/
Theano is a python library for defining and evaluating mathematical expressions with numerical arrays.

https://keras.io/
Keras is a minimalist, highly modular neural network library in the spirit of Torch, written in Python, that uses Theano under the hood for optimized tensor manipulation on GPU and CPU.

http://deeplearning.net/software/pylearn2/
Pylearn2 is a library that wraps a lot of models and training algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent that are commonly used in Deep Learning.

https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne
Lasagne  is a lightweight library to build and train neural networks in Theano.

https://github.com/mila-iqia/blocks
Blocks a framework that helps you build neural network models on top of Theano.

http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/
Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.

https://github.com/dnouri/nolearn
nolearn contains a number of wrappers and abstractions around existing neural network libraries, most notably Lasagne, along with a few machine learning utility modules.
