    - if its right loser can retain or they lose the card
  
  5. Player that won the previous round can get a random card
  
  6. Booster - one time use - when playing a card, if card type and booster type matches, can be played to increase variable values by 50%

  08. Lose 2 Cards (Randomly chosen by the opponent)

  09. Say something about the Library to make your opponent lose your card

  10. Say one Con (negative) of the library you are holding or lose your card



#### How to play?
 - 2 Players can get 10 (or more) general cards (Lib cards)

 - Player 1 gets the Catalyst card and follow the procedure
    ```
Example:
if option 1 (Higher points win), she has to pick the higher card to beat the player
if the player 2 has higher number on the specific key, player 2 wins
    ```

 - Player 2 gets the Catalyst card and follow the procedure


### Player feedbacks

  - catalyst card wording should be improved

  - Rules should be conveyed in simplier terms

  - Lose/regain/get should be specified clearly catalyst cards

  - Single/Duel should be specified
  
  - Would be better in physical mode

  - Some more mechanics
### Target

 - 50 library card
 - 50 catalyst
