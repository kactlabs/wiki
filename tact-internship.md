# Intern Opportunity at TactLabs

Start your career with us~



### TactLabs Internship:

First of all, if you are thinking of making BIG money by doing internship, TactLabs may not be the right place for you. We might pay you one time stipend after 550 hours and renew your contract if we like your contribution.

TactLabs hire students as a part of social support (like Social Internship), care more about diversity and fresh candidates. We want to give some opportunities to all interested and eligible stuents.

We care about REAL Interest rather than TRENDY interest. If you think ML is very trendy and you want to be part of it, TactLabs might not be for you.

### How to get TactLabs Intern Offer?
* We don't need your resume. As resume is useless for us, we don't have time to parse that.
* Just send your Github, Kaggle, Medium, Website links to info@tactii.com and saying "Intern Opportunity" as a subject.
* If we find you are fit for TactLabs, we will do a first round of interview for 15-30 mins.
* Once first round is done, you will be asked to do 20 days Learning Challenge as a second round. 
* As a final round, you will have to Job Shadow some of our interns for 50 Hours and get a Certificate from TactLabs. 
* Based on the feedback from the people you job shadowed, we will give you an offer letter.
