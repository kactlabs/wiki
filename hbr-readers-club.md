**Title**: Good Leadership Is About Communicating “Why”

**Link**: https://hbr.org/2020/05/good-leadership-is-about-communicating-why

**Participants**: Raja CSP, Saif Ali Shaik, Mathivanan, ArunRajkumar

**Power Points - Raja**:
```
But if we present without addressing our audience’s core questions of what, how, and why, we’ll sow more confusion than we bring clarity.

If they don’t know why a new action is necessary, they won’t be motivated to help you. 
They’ll continue with their current comfortable behaviors, thank you very much.

Communicators often overlook answering why for two key reasons:
They assume explaining what and how is the fastest way to influence their audience.
They think the answer to why is so self-evident it doesn’t need unpacking.

For example, “We need to improve our process, because ____.” Whatever reason follows a “we need to ______, because _______ .” 
Whatever that second blank is, will answer the question of “why.

In times like these, your customers and your employees need your wisdom and leadership more than ever, and you have a unique opportunity to move them forward in the midst of uncertainty.
