# TactSay Tech: AIOHTTP

1. It Supports both client and server side of HTTP protocol.

2. It Supports both client and server Web-Sockets out-of-the-box and avoids Callback Hell.

3. Provides Web-server with middlewares and plugable routing.

4. Lightweight: AIOHTTP is designed to be lightweight and has a minimalistic core, which makes it fast and efficient.

5. HTTP and WebSocket support: AIOHTTP supports both HTTP and WebSocket protocols, allowing you to build real-time applications with bidirectional communication.

6. Routing: AIOHTTP provides a flexible routing system that allows you to define URL patterns and map them to specific handler functions, making it easy to build RESTful APIs.

7. Middlewares: AIOHTTP supports middlewares, which are functions that can intercept and modify both incoming requests and outgoing responses. Middlewares are useful for implementing authentication, logging, error handling, and more.

8. Template engine support: AIOHTTP integrates with popular Python template engines like Jinja2 and Mako, allowing you to generate dynamic HTML pages.

9. Session handling: AIOHTTP provides built-in support for session management, allowing you to store and retrieve user-specific data across multiple requests.

10.WebSocket server push: AIOHTTP allows you to push data from the server to connected WebSocket clients, enabling real-time updates and notifications.
